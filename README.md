# Motorsport Performance Analysis

## 🏎️ Project Overview
This MATLAB project analyzes motorsport performance metrics, focusing on lap times, tire degradation, sector splits, top speed variation, and driver comparisons. It's part of my personal portfolio as a Computer Science student with a passion for motorsport data and simulation.

## 📊 Key Features
- Lap time analysis and consistency evaluation  
- Tire degradation simulation  
- Sector performance breakdown  
- Top speed trend monitoring  
- Stint comparison between two drivers  
- Compound type analysis (Soft, Medium, Hard)  

## 📁 Files Included
- `First_Script.m` – MATLAB script containing all analysis logic and visualizations  
- `lap_times.csv` – Sample dataset used for demonstration purposes  

## ⚙️ Requirements
- MATLAB (R2023 or later recommended)
- No additional toolboxes required for this version

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory  
3. Load `lap_times.csv` into the MATLAB workspace  
4. Run `First_Script.m` to execute the full analysis  
5. Review the plots and output for lap trends, tire simulation, and more  

## 🔍 Analysis Techniques
The script uses built-in MATLAB plotting and array operations to simulate:
- Tire degradation impact on lap time
- Lap time trends over stints
- Differences in driver performance
- Basic compound behavior and stint evolution

Each section of the script is modular and commented for easy expansion or reuse.


## 🔧 Future Plans
- Modularize the code with functions  
- Automate CSV selection and input  
- Expand with real-world telemetry or race simulation data  
- Create a basic app using MATLAB App Designer

## 🙋 About Me
I'm currently studying Computer Science in Dublin and building a portfolio focused on simulation and data analysis with the goal of contributing to motorsport innovation—ideally within F1 or high-performance automotive teams.
